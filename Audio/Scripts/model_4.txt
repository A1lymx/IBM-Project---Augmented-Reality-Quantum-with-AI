Let's start with the first layer of a quantum computer, the foundation of these extraordinary machines. At this level, we're talking about the physical qubits themselves. These aren't your ordinary bits; they're the heart and soul of quantum computing. Each qubit can be in multiple states at once, thanks to superposition. This layer is where the magic begins, with qubits held in supercooled environments, allowing them to operate in this unique quantum state. It's a bit like setting the stage for an intricate dance, where each dancer (or qubit) can move in multiple ways simultaneously.
