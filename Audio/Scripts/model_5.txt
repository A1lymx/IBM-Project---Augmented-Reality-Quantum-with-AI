Moving up to the second layer, we delve into the control mechanisms that manipulate these qubits. This is where the quantum system starts to look a bit more like a computer. We use precision electronics to send signals to the qubits, telling them how to interact, change states, and ultimately, process information. It's akin to choreographing the dance of the qubits set up in the first layer, ensuring each step is perfectly timed and executed to maintain the delicate balance of their quantum states.
