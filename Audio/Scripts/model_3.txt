Unlike traditional bits, qubits can perform complex operations through the magic of superconductors, which allow electrons to flow without any resistance at extremely low temperatures. This enables phenomena like quantum tunneling, essential for the functioning of qubits. 

Our quantum computers use a special kind of superconductor called Josephson junctions to manipulate qubits with precision. By controlling these qubits, we can perform operations that tap into the heart of quantum mechanics, like putting information into a state of superposition, where it can represent multiple possibilities at once. 

Real magic happens when qubits become entangled, meaning the state of one qubit will directly affect another, no matter the distance between them. This, along with superposition, allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of information simultaneously, leading to the solution of complex problems through a dance of probabilities known as interference. 

As we peel back the layers of quantum computers, we'll explore the intricate details of how these incredible machines operate and the principles behind them. 

And we're not just stopping at the theory. We'll also dive into the real-world applications of quantum computing, showing how it has the potential to revolutionize industries by solving problems that were previously thought to be unsolvable 

Imagine a quantum processor as small as the chip in your laptop, but the whole quantum system is as big as a car, mostly due to the cooling systems needed to keep it running at incredibly low temperatures. This is crucial for maintaining the delicate state of quantum bits, or qubits, and preventing them from losing their quantum properties.
