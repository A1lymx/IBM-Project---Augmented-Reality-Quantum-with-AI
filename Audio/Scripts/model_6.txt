At the third layer, we integrate the quantum computer with classical computing elements. This layer acts as the bridge between the quantum and classical worlds. Here, we interpret the outcomes of quantum computations and translate them into something we can use and understand. It's where the results of the qubits' dance are turned into meaningful information, like converting the intricate movements of a ballet into a story that the audience can appreciate and understand.
